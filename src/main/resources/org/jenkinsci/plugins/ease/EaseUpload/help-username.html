        Enter the User ID for a valid user in your Apperian organization.
        The user must have valid permissions for adding applications to Apperian.
        Based on this User ID, the Apperian web service identifies your organization in the Apperian database.
        For more information on user permissions, see Managing Users
        (<a href="https://help.apperian.com/display/pub/Managing+Users">https://help.apperian.com/display/pub/Managing+Users</a>)
        in the Apperian Documentation Center.

        You can leave User ID and Password blank if you have stored valid credentials with the Jenkins Credentials plugin.
        Note that the plugin matches the domain set for the stored credentials with the domain in the API endpoint.
