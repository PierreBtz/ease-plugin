    <p>
        The plugin uses this filename pattern to search for the file that should be uploaded.
        If your project builds multiple versions of the application binary (for example, one that is signed and one that is unsigned),
        use this field to explicitly specify the correct file in the workspace. For example: target/android-app-v*.apk.
