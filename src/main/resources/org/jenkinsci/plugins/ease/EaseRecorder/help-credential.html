        Select the credentials you want to use to sign the app.
        If there are no credentials listed, or if you need to add different credentials,

        When you re-sign an iOS or Android app that was already installed on any of your users' devices,
        it is important that you sign it with the same credentials used to previously sign it.
        iOS and Android will not allow a user to install an update of an app if the update is signed with different
        credentials than the currently installed version.
